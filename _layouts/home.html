		  <p>Hi, this is Xiaobin. I am currently working as a post-doctoral
		  Research Associate at the <a href="https://www.mml.cam.ac.uk/">Faculty of Modern and Medieval Languages </a> of <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/">the University of Cambridge</a>, where my research is focused on the project Linguistic Typology and Learneability in Second Language led by <a href="http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/ta259/">Dr.  Dora Alexopoulou</a>.</p>

		  <p>Before coming to the UK, I did my PhD at the <a
				href="http://www.lead.uni-tuebingen.de/">LEAD Graduate School &
				Research Network</a> of the <a
				href="http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/">Universität Tübingen</a> in
		Germany. I worked with a team led by <a
				href="http://purl.org/dm">Prof. Detmar Meurers</a> whose
		research interests were Computational Linguistics and its application in
		foreign language teaching. We were interested in building Intelligent
		Computer Asisted Language Learning (ICALL) systems that utilized Natural
		Language Processing (NLP) technologies and were informed by second
		language acquisition theories and practice. </p>

		  <p>Personally, my prvious research focused on automatic
		  assessment of text complexity and on how to link learner proficiency
		  with text complexity. The purpose of this research was to find an
		  optimal method to automatically assign texts of appropriate difficulty
		  levels based on the reader's language proficiencies. The results of
		  this research have been documented in my PhD Thesis.</p>

		  <p>I also worked as an English lecturer for six
		  years at the <a href="http://www.scut.edu.cn/sfl/">School of Foreign
		  Languages</a> of the <a href="http://www.scut.edu.cn/">South China
	 University of Technology</a>, where I also obtained my Bachelor's and
Master's Degrees in English and Applied Linguistics. I met my wife there too.
:)</p>

		  <p>I am leading a happy life with my wonderful wife Wei Chang and our
		  two adorable children Danning and Yuanning in Cambridge, UK.</p>
