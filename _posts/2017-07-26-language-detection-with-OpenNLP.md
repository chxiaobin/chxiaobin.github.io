Language detection refers to the automatic detection of the language in which a
document is written. A search on the Internet results in existing tools like
[Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org),
[TextCat](http://textcat.sourceforge.net/), and the [Java Language Detection
Library](http://textcat.sourceforge.net/). Some of these tools are
general-purpose document classification libraries. Others are specifically
designed for language detection. Another option is to use a general-purpose natural language processing library like OpenNLP. In this post, I am going to describe how to use the ready-made library Tika and OpenNLP for the language detection task.
