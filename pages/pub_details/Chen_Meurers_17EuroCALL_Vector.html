		Reading texts of appropriate difficulty levels to L2 learners’
		proficiency levels provides them with comprehensible input (Krashen,
		1985) that helps promote their L2 proficiencies, enables them to practice
		being competent readers, and motivates them to read more (Milone and
		Biemiller, 2014). However, whether a reading text is appropriate to an
		individual reader is a rather subjective issue, because reading
		comprehension is affected not only by the complexity of the text, but
		also by a number of reader-related factors such as the purpose of
		reading, the reader’s ability, prior knowledge, and interests (Lexile,
		2007). As a result, a challenge that foreign language teachers usually
		face is how to choose suitable reading materials for learners of
		different L2 proficiency levels.
		</p>

		<p>
		One solution to this problem is to assess the readability of a text
		either qualitatively (Pearson and Hiebert, 2014) or quantitatively
		(Benjamin, 2012; Collins-Thompson, 2014; Zakaluk and Samuels, 1988)
		before it is assigned to students. Most research opts for the
		quantitative approach because it is considered more objective and easier
		to automatize with Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies.
		However, one serious drawback with previous research on text readability
		is that it overlooks the interaction between the reader and the text
		(Kintsch and Vipond, 1979).
		</p>

		<p>
		Cunningham and Mesmer (2014) proposed a Theoretical Model of Text
		Complexity that distinguished text complexity from text difficulty. While
		the former refers to the word-, syntatic- and discoursal-level features
		of a text, the latter considers the readers’ performance on certain tasks
		based on the text. However, there has been little research on how the two
		concepts can be linked so as to inform the design of ICALL systems that
		are capable of choosing texts of appropriate reading levels for
		individual learners.
		</p>

		<p>
		The present study proposes using Euclidean distance of textual feature
		vectors for linking text complexity and learner proficiency. It is
		hypothesized that the same set of textual features can be used to unify
		the reading input and the learner production into the same vector space
		so that it would be possible to decide whether a reading text is at an
		appropriate level for learners of specific proficiency levels. Following
		Vajjala andMeurers’s (2012) feature schemes for text complexity, 102
		lexical and syntactic features were extracted from and used as
		representational vectors of each text from a 5-level authentic reading
		corpus from Newsela 1 and a 2-level L2 writing corpus (Wang and Wang,
		2015). It was found that the Euclidean vector distances are positively
		correlated with reading level differences with authentic reading texts,
		i.e., greater level differences result in greater vector distance and
		vice versa (ANOVA F (3, 296) = 403.1, p &lt; .001; Post hoc TukeyHSD test
		p &lt; .001). Similarly, the vector distance between the higher-level
		writings and an authentic reading input to solicit the writings is
		shorter than that between the lower-level writings and the input (Paired
		sample T-test: t = 3.35, df = 47, p ≤ .001).
		</p>

		</p>
		These results validated the proposed method which forms the basis for
		designing ICALL systems for reading text selection based on individual
		leaner’s L2 proficiency.
