		The use of mobile device in language learning and teaching has long been
		a field of immense interest among language educators and researchers,
		especially under the current tide of mobile fad. This paper presents the
		state-of-the-art mobile technologies that can facilitate foreign language
		learning. Examples of language learning apps on these mobile devices are
		reviewed, and the ways in which these mobile technologies can be combined
		with traditional language teaching and learning are discussed. It is
		concluded that in order to make effective use of mobile technologies,
		teachers need to develop pedagogically sound methods while acknowledging
		the instrumental role of mobile assisted language learning in language
		instruction.
