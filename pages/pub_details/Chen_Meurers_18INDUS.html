		In this talk, we presented evidence of linguistic complexity analysis as
		an approach to relate learner production with input for learners to
		have a better account for the alignment effect.  Complexity analysis of
		learner production can be used to characterize the interlanguage of the
		learner, while the analysis of input for learners can be use characterize
		the challenge for them. Results from our experiments proved the validity
		of using complexity to empirical implement Krashen's Input Hypothesis, or
		the "i + 1". In the talk, we also presented an ICALL system called
		Syntactic Benchmark that implements the research results.
