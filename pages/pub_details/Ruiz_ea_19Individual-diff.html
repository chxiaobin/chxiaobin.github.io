		The present study compared lab-based and web-based versions of
		cognitive individual difference measures widely used in second language
		research (working memory and declarative memory). Our objective was to
		validate web-based versions of these tests for future research and to
		make these measures available for the wider second language research
		community, thus contributing to the study of individual differences in
		language learning. The establishment of measurement equivalence of the
		two administration modes is important because web-based testing allows
		researchers to address methodological challenges such as restricted
		population sampling, low statistical power, and small sample sizes. Our
		results indicate that the lab-based and web-based versions of the tests
		were equivalent, i.e., scores of the two test modes correlated. The
		strength of the relationships, however, varied as a function of the
		kind of measure, with equivalence appearing to be stronger in both the
		working memory and the verbal declarative memory tests, and less so in
		the nonverbal declarative memory test. Overall, the study provides
		evidence that web-based testing of cognitive abilities can produce
		similar performance scores as in the lab.
