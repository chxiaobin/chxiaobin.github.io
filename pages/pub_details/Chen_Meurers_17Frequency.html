		<p> Assessment of text readability is important for assigning texts at
		the appropriate level to readers at different proficiency levels. The
		present research approached readability assessment from the lexical
		perspective of word frequencies derived from corpora assumed to reflect
		typical language experience. Three studies were conducted to test how the
		word-level feature of word frequency can be aggregated to characterise
		text-level readability. The results show that an effective use of word
		frequency for text readability assessment should take a range of
		characteristics of the distribution of words frequencies into account.
		For characterizing text readability, taking into account the standard
		deviation in addition to the mean word frequencies already significantly
		increases results. The best results are obtained using the mean
		frequencies of the words in language frequency bands or in bands obtained
		by agglomerative clustering of the word frequencies in the documents â€“
		though a comparison of within-corpus and cross-corpus results shows the
		limited generalizability of using high numbers of fine-grained frequency
		bands. Overall, the study advances our understanding of the relationship
		between word frequency and text readability and provides concrete options
		for more effectively making use of lexical frequency information in
		practice.  </p>
