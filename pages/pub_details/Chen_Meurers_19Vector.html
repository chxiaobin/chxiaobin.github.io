		How can we identify authentic reading material that matches the
		learner's proficiency and fosters their language development?
		Traditionally, this involves assigning a one-dimensional label to the
		text that identifies the grade or proficiency level of the learners
		that the text is intended for. Such an approach is inadequate given
		that both the text complexity and proficiency constructs are
		multi-dimensional in nature. We propose to instead link readers and
		texts through multidimensional vectors characterizing the linguistic
		complexity of the reading material and that of texts written by the
		learners as proxy of their proficiency level. We first validate the
		approach using a leveled reading corpus by showing that vector
		distances computed on the complexity representations can serve the
		function of the traditional labels. We then highlight the advantage of
		the multi-dimensional approach using data from a continuation writing
		task, showing that it makes it possible to study individual complexity
		dimensions and to explore different degrees of challenge for different
		dimensions. Our approach essentially makes it possible to empirically
		investigate the +1 of Krashen's i+1, the challenge that best fosters
		development given the learner's interlanguage. On the practical side,
		we discuss an ICALL system demonstrating the viability of the approach
		in real-life.
