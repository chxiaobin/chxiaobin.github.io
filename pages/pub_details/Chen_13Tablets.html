		Mobile-assisted language learning (MALL), a relatively new area of
		CALL inquiry, is gaining more and more attention from language educators
		with the development of new mobile devices. Tablet computers---featuring
		high mobility, convenient network connectivity, and smart application
		extendibility---are part of a wave of the latest mobile inventions; how
		these new mobile devices enhance MALL and how students perceive them as a
		language learning tool have yet to be broadly explored. This action
		research project sought to investigate how students used tablet computers
		to learn English in informal settings outside of class and how to foster
		more effective usage of the tablet for independent language learning. The
		study shows that tablet computers are ideal tools for creating an
		interactive, collaborative, and ubiquitous environment for language
		learning, provided that the technological affordances of the device have
		been fully explored with the students. This investigation also reveals
		that students have a generally favorable attitude towards the usability,
		effectiveness, and satisfaction of tablet computers for MALL.
