		<p>
		Informed by research on readability and language acquisition,
		computational linguists have developed sophisticated tools for the
		analysis of linguistic complexity. While some tools are starting to
		become accessible on the web, there still is a disconnect between the
		features that can in principle be identified based on state-of-the-art
		computational linguistic analysis, and the analyses a teacher, textbook
		writer, or second language acquisition researcher can readily obtain and
		visualize for their own collection of texts.  This short paper presents a
		web-based tool development that aims to meet this challenge. The Common
		Text Analysis Platform (CTAP) is designed to support fully configurable
		linguistic feature extraction for a wide range of complexity analyses. It
		features a user-friendly interface, modularized and reusable analysis
		component integration, and flexible corpus and feature management.
		Building on the Unstructured Information Management framework (UIMA),
		CTAP readily supports integration of state-of-the-art NLP and complexity
		feature extraction maintaining modularization and reusability. CTAP
		thereby aims at providing a common platform for complexity analysis,
		encouraging research collaboration and sharing of feature extraction
		components to jointly advance the state-of-the-art in complexity analysis
		in a form that readily supports real-life use by ordinary users.
