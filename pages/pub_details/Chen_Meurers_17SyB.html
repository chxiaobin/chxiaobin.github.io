		This paper introduces an Intelligent Computer Assisted Language Learning
		system designed to provide reading input for language learners based on
		the syntactic complexity of their language production. The system
		analyzes the linguistic complexity of texts produced by the user and of
		texts in a pedagogic target language corpus to identify texts that are
		well-suited to foster acquisition. These texts provide developmental
		benchmarks offering an individually tailored language challenge, making
		ideas such as Krashen’s i+1 or Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development
		concrete and empirically explorable in terms of a broad range of
		complexity measures in all dimensions of linguistic modeling.
