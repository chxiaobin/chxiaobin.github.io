		<p>
		The Common Text Analysis Platform (CTAP) is a Web-based computational
		system for automatic extraction of linguistic features from language
		productions. It combines state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing
		(NLP) technologies and complexity research to provide language
		researchers and education practitioners a tool to effectively and
		efficiently analyze large amount of language data.
		</p>

		<p>
		One use case of the CTAP platform is supporting modeling of text
		readability or language proficiency development from the complexity
		perspective (Housen et al., 2012), which is difficult, if not impossible,
		without the help of modern NLP technologies since it usually involves
		analysis of large quantities of texts. A number of automatic complexity
		analysis tools such as the Syntactic and Lexical Complexity Analyzers
		(Lu, 2010), CohMetrix (McNamara et al., 2014), and the Tool for the
		Automatic Analysis of Lexical Sophistication (Kyle and Crossley, 2015)
		have emerged in the past few years. Although these systems provide a
		valuable toolkit for analyzing language, they are geared more towards
		expert users of computers. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of large
		volumes of language data is only achievable by utilizing the individual
		tools separately, because each of the tool deals with one or a few
		aspects of the complexity construct.  Consequently, a platform that
		allows easy and comprehensive acquisition of complexity measures from
		texts to support research on readability assessment, performance
		assessment and proficiency development is on demand.
		</p>

		<p>
		The CTAP system is designed to meet these needs. It features 1) a
		consistent, easy-to-use, and friendly user interface, 2) modularized,
		reusable, and collaborative development of analysis components, and 3)
		flexible corpus and feature management. Four main user modules, namely
		the Corpus Manager, the Feature Selector, the Analysis Generator, and the
		Result Visualizer and a server module make up the system. The Corpus
		Manager helps users organize language materials to be analyzed into
		corpora, labeled groups, and corpus folders. The Feature Selector allows
		for selection of different complexity measures for different analysis
		needs. The selected features could then be applied to different corpora
		as an analysis with the Analysis Generator. The analysis results or
		complexity feature values can be plotted with the Result Visualizer or be
		downloaded as Comma Separated Values files for further analysis with
		external statistical tools. 
		</p>

		<p>
		More than 170 complexity features including measures of lexical density,
		lexical variation, lexical sophistication and syntactic complexity have
		been included into the CTAP system and the feature list will keep growing
		with contributions from developers all over the world thanks to the
		open-source nature of the system. This is by far the most comprehensive
		and easy-to-use system freely available online for complexity analysis.
		</p>

		</p>
		The CTAP system as both a running production Web application and an
		open-source project for collaboration is accessible at <a
		href="http://ctapweb.com">http://ctapweb.com</a> and <a
  href="https://github.com/ctapweb/">https://github.com/ctapweb</a>
  respectively.
