		<p> Assessment of text readability is important for assigning texts of
		appropriate levels for readers of different proficiencies. The present
		research approached readability assessment from the lexical perspective
		of word frequencies. Three studies were conducted to test whether and how
		the word-level feature of word frequency can be aggregated to
		characterise the text-level feature of readability. Results showed that
		it is effective to use word frequency for text readability assessment,
		given that the frequency norm contains measures that accurately reflects
		the cognitive load involved in vocabulary perception and retrieval. This
		study merits itself not only in providing a better understanding of the
		relationship between word frequency and text readability, but also in
		pointing to new methods on how to better utilise textual features for
		readability assessment.  </p>
