		<p> Reading texts of appropriate levels enables language learners to
		practice being competent readers and motivates them to read more (Milone
		& Biemiller, 2014).  A major concern for language teachers is thus on how
		to match students’ reading abilities with the texts’ complexity levels.
		Readability assessment provides a way to measure text complexity and
		assign text levels. The process has been automatized with natural
		language processing and machine learning tools, the outcome of which are
		usually grade/age level estimates of the reading texts, because the tools
		are built on classification models trained with features extracted from
		the text and their gold-standard levels provided by expert teachers or
		publishers of the text.  </p>

		<p> Despite the tools’ highly accurate estimates, their application in
		actual reading system design is limited by the lack of a method to link
		the learner’s pro-ficiency to the text’s readability level. The present
		study proposed using multidimensional vector distance as a measure of
		text level differences and using it to link learner proficiency and text
		complexity levels. Text features used in (Vajjala & Meurers, 2012) were
		extracted from both learner texts and reading texts to form vectors
		representing the students’ proficiency and the reading text’s complexity
		level. Our hypothesis was that vector distances were correlated with
		level differences, i.e., greater level differences would result in
		greater vector distance.	</p>

		<p> The hypothesis was tested with two data sets, one from Wang and
		Wang’s (2015) continuation writing experiments and the other involved 30
		randomly selected articles from the educational website Newsela
		(www.newsela.com). In Wang and Wang’s (2015) study, 48 EFL students were
		required to continue writing stories in English after reading the
		beginning stories whose endings were ommited. It was found that after
		reading an English version of a story, students made less mistakes in
		their writings than after reading a Chinese version of it.  The authors
		attributed the results to the alignment effect of language
		learning,stating that the writings after reading the English story input
		had an improved quality and is closer to the level of the input texts.
		Using this data set, we tested the hypothesis that text vector distances
		between writings after reading Chinese input and the input text are
		greater than those between the English input and the writen output. The
		results with paired sample t-test confirmed this hypothesis (T(47) =
		3.35, p ≤ .001).  </p>

		<p>The 30 articles, each in 5 different reading levels, from Newsela were
		used to test the hypothesis that greater level gaps (e.g., the distance
		between levels 1 and 5 in comparison to that between levels 1 and 2) are
		associated with greater vector distances. One-way ANOVA and post-hoc
		Tukey test results confirmed the hypothesis (F(3, 296) = 403.1, p &lt; 
		.001). With the increase of level differences, larger vector distances
		were observed.</p> 
		
		<p>This study confirmed that it is valid to use distances between text
		feature vectors to measure the texts’ reading level differences. It is
		also a valid method to link reading proficiency with text readability,
		hence a potentially viable method for automatic individualized reading
		text assignment for language development.</p>
