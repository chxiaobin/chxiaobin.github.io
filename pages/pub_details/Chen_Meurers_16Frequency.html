		Natural language processing (NLP) methodologies
		have been widely adopted for readability
		assessment and greatly enhanced predictive
		accuracy. In the present study, we study
		a well-established feature, the frequency of a
		word in common language use, and systematically
		explore how such a word-level feature
		is best used to characterize the reading levels
		of texts, a text-level classification problem.
		While traditionally such word-level features
		are simply averaged for all words of given
		text, we show that a richer representation leads
		to significantly better predictive models.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		A basic approach adding a feature for the
		standard deviation already shows clear gains,
		and two more complex options systematically
		integrating more frequency information are
		explored: (i) encoding separate means for
		the words of a text according to which frequency
		band of the language they occur in,
		and (ii) encoding the mean of each cluster of
		words obtained by agglomerative hierarchical
		clustering of the words in the text based on
		their frequency. The former organizes frequency
		around general language characteristics,
		whereas the latter aims to lose as little
		information as possible about the distribution
		of word frequencies in a given text. To investigate
		the generalizability of the results, we
		compare cross-validation experiments within
		a corpus with cross-corpus experiments testing
		on the Common Core State Standards reference
		texts. We also contrast two different
		frequency norms and compare frequency with
		a measure of contextual diversity.
