		  <p> The Common Text Analysis Platform is a set of tools that helps you
		  manage your text corpus and automatically analyze them for various
		  purposes. Potential uses of the system include text complexity
		  assessment, plagiarism detection, authorship attrition, and native
		  language detection, etc.  The CTAP Tools include modules for corpus
		  management, feature selection, analysis generation, and result
		  visualization. Combination of the modules makes your text analysis
		  highly flexible.  </p>
