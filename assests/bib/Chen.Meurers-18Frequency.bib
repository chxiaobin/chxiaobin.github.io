		  at the appropriate level to readers at different proficiency levels.
				The present research approached readability assessment from the
				lexical perspective of word frequencies derived from corpora
				assumed to reflect typical language experience. Three studies were
				conducted to test how the word-level feature of word frequency can
				be aggregated to characterise text-level readability. The results
				show that an effective use of word frequency for text readability
				assessment should take a range of characteristics of the
				distribution of words frequencies into account. For characterizing
				text readability, taking into account the standard deviation in
				addition to the mean word frequencies already significantly
				increases results. The best results are obtained using the mean
				frequencies of the words in language frequency bands or in bands
				obtained by agglomerative clustering of the word frequencies in the
				documents â€“ though a comparison of within-corpus and cross-corpus
				results shows the limited generalizability of using high numbers of
				fine-grained frequency bands. Overall, the study advances our
				understanding of the relationship between word frequency and text
				readability and provides concrete options for more effectively
				making use of lexical frequency information in practice.},
