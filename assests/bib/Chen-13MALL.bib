		  The pervasive use of mobile technology not only brings great
		  convenience to people's life, but also changes the way people study.
		  Nowadays, it is quite common for students to utilize smart phones,
		  tablet computers, portable multimedia players and other mobile devices
		  to learn a foreign language, These tools provide them with convenient
		  access to learning materials, while at the same time eliminated the
		  time and space limits of foreign language learning, making up for the
		  lack of interactivity, collaboration, and real context contact of the
		  traditional foreign language classroom. The present paper attempts to
		  define mobile assisted language learning, look at the features of this
		  new learning mode, and discuss the advantages and challenges of it with
		  regard to the traditional language learning mode. It is concluded that
		  before foreign language teachers adopt these mobile technologies in
		  their language teaching practice, the technological affordances of
		  different mobile devices need to be fully considered, so as to be able
		  to design language activities that are in line with language
		  acquisition and cognitive laws. Only by doing this can language
		  teachers effectively guide their students to utilize mobile
		  technologies for language learning.
