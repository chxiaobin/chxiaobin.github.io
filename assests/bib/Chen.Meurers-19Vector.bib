		 How can we identify authentic reading material that matches the
			 learner's proficiency and fosters their language development?
			 Traditionally, this involves assigning a one-dimensional label to
			 the text that identifies the grade or proficiency level of the
			 learners that the text is intended for. Such an approach is
			 inadequate given that both the text complexity and proficiency
			 constructs are multi-dimensional in nature. We propose to instead
			 link readers and texts through multidimensional vectors
			 characterizing the linguistic complexity of the reading material
			 and that of texts written by the learners as proxy of their
			 proficiency level. We first validate the approach using a leveled
			 reading corpus by showing that vector distances computed on the
			 complexity representations can serve the function of the
			 traditional labels. We then highlight the advantage of the
			 multi-dimensional approach using data from a continuation writing
			 task, showing that it makes it possible to study individual
			 complexity dimensions and to explore different degrees of
			 challenge for different dimensions. Our approach essentially makes
			 it possible to empirically investigate the +1 of Krashen's i+1,
		 the challenge that best fosters development given the learner's
			 interlanguage. On the practical side, we discuss an ICALL system
			 demonstrating the viability of the approach in real-life.
