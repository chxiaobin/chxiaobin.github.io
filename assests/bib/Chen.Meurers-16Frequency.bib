		  Natural language processing (NLP) methodologies have been widely
		  adopted for readability assessment and greatly enhanced predictive
		  accuracy. In the present study, we study a well-established feature,
		  the frequency of a word in common language use, and systematically
		  explore how such a word-level feature is best used to characterize the
		  reading levels of texts, a text-level classification problem. While
		  traditionally such word-level features are simply averaged for all
		  words of given text, we show that a richer representation leads to
		  significantly better predictive models.

		  A basic approach adding a feature for the standard deviation already
		  shows clear gains, and two more complex options systematically
		  integrating more frequency information are explored: (i) encoding
		  separate means for the words of a text according to which frequency
		  band of the language they occur in, and (ii) encoding the mean of each
		  cluster of words obtained by agglomerative hierarchical clustering of
		  the words in the text based on their frequency. The former organizes
		  frequency around general language characteristics, whereas the latter
		  aims to lose as little information as possible about the distribution
		  of word frequencies in a given text. To investigate the
		  generalizability of the results, we compare cross-validation
		  experiments within a corpus with cross-corpus experiments testing on
		  the Common Core State Standards reference texts. We also contrast two
		  different frequency norms and compare frequency with a measure of
		  contextual diversity.
