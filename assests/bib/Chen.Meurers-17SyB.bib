	 abstract = {This paper introduces an Intelligent Computer Assisted Language
		  Learning system designed to provide reading input for language learners
		  based on the syntactic complexity of their language production. The
		  system analyzes the linguistic complexity of texts produced by the user
		  and of texts in a pedagogic target language corpus to identify texts
		  that are well-suited to foster acquisition. These texts provide
		  developmental benchmarks offering an individually tailored language
		  challenge, making ideas such as Krashen’s i+1 or Vygotsky’s Zone of
		  Proximal Development concrete and empirically explorable in terms of a
		  broad range of complexity measures in all dimensions of linguistic
		  modeling.}
