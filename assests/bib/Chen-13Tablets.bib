		  Mobile-assisted language learning (MALL), a relatively new area of CALL
		  inquiry, is gaining more and more attention from language educators
		  with the development of new mobile devices. Tablet
		  computers---featuring high mobility, convenient network connectivity,
		  and smart application extendibility---are part of a wave of the latest
		  mobile inventions; how these new mobile devices enhance MALL and how
		  students perceive them as a language learning tool have yet to be
		  broadly explored. This action research project sought to investigate
		  how students used tablet computers to learn English in informal
		  settings outside of class and how to foster more effective usage of the
		  tablet for independent language learning. The study shows that tablet
		  computers are ideal tools for creating an interactive, collaborative,
		  and ubiquitous environment for language learning, provided that the
		  technological affordances of the device have been fully explored with
		  the students. This investigation also reveals that students have a
		  generally favorable attitude towards the usability, effectiveness, and
		  satisfaction of tablet computers for MALL.
