	 abstract = {Informed by research on readability and language acquisition,
		  computational linguists have developed sophisticated tools for the
		  analysis of linguistic complexity. While some tools are starting to
		  become accessible on the web, there still is a disconnect between the
		  features that can in principle be identified based on state-of-the-art
		  computational linguistic analysis, and the analyses a teacher, textbook
		  writer, or second language acquisition researcher can readily obtain
		  and visualize for their own collection of texts. This short paper
		  presents a web-based tool development that aims to meet this challenge.
		  The Common Text Analysis Platform (CTAP) is designed to support fully
		  configurable linguistic feature extraction for a wide range of
		  complexity analyses. It features a user-friendly interface, modularized
		  and reusable analysis component integration, and flexible corpus and
		  feature management. Building on the Unstructured Information Management
		  framework (UIMA), CTAP readily supports integration of state-of-the-art
		  NLP and complexity feature extraction maintaining modularization and
		  reusability. CTAP thereby aims at providing a common platform for
		  complexity analysis, encouraging research collaboration and sharing of
		  feature extraction components to jointly advance the state-of-the-art
		  in complexity analysis in a form that readily supports real-life use by
		  ordinary users.}
