		 The present study compared lab-based and web-based versions of
		 cognitive individual difference measures widely used in second
		 language research (working memory and declarative memory). Our
		 objective was to validate web-based versions of these tests for future
		 research and to make these measures available for the wider second
		 language research community, thus contributing to the study of
		 individual differences in language learning. The establishment of
		 measurement equivalence of the two administration modes is important
		 because web-based testing allows researchers to address methodological
		 challenges such as restricted population sampling, low statistical
		 power, and small sample sizes. Our results indicate that the lab-based
		 and web-based versions of the tests were equivalent, i.e., scores of
		 the two test modes correlated. The strength of the relationships,
		 however, varied as a function of the kind of measure, with equivalence
		 appearing to be stronger in both the working memory and the verbal
		 declarative memory tests, and less so in the nonverbal declarative
		 memory test. Overall, the study provides evidence that web-based
		 testing of cognitive abilities can produce similar performance scores
		 as in the lab.
